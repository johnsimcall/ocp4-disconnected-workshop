In this lab, we'll prepare the low side.

== Creating a Prep System

Let's start by creating a prep system so we can begin downloading content.

. Collect the IDs for your VPC and public subnet and set environment variables for them:
+
[,execute]
----
VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs | jq '.Vpcs[] | select(.Tags[].Value=="disco").VpcId' -r)
echo $VPC_ID

PUBLIC_SUBNET=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets | jq '.Subnets[] | select(.Tags[].Value=="disco-public").SubnetId' -r)
echo $PUBLIC_SUBNET
----

. Create a Security Group and collect its ID.
We're going to use this for both the prep system, and later for the bastion server:
+
[,execute]
----
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name disco-sg --description disco-sg --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} --tag-specifications "ResourceType=security-group,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=disco-sg}]"

SG_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=disco-sg" | jq -r '.SecurityGroups[0].GroupId')
echo $SG_ID
----

. Open ports 22 for SSH access, and 8443 for mirror registry communication.
We're going to allow traffic from all sources for simplicity (`0.0.0.0/0`), but this is likely to be more restrictive in real world environments:
+
[,execute]
----
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $SG_ID --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $SG_ID --protocol tcp --port 8443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
----

. Next we'll specify an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use for our prep system.
For this lab, we'll just use the https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#ImageDetails:imageId=ami-0fe630eb857a6ec83[Marketplace AMI for RHEL 9] in `us-east-1`:
+
[,execute]
----
AMI_ID="ami-0fe630eb857a6ec83"
----

. Ready to launch!
ðŸš€ We'll use the `t3.micro` instance type, which offers 1GiB of RAM and 2vCPUs, along with a 50GiB volume to ensure we have enough storage for mirrored content:
+
[,execute]
----
PREP_SYSTEM_NAME="disco-prep-system"

aws ec2 run-instances --image-id $AMI_ID --count 1 --instance-type t3.micro --key-name disco-key --security-group-ids $SG_ID --subnet-id $PUBLIC_SUBNET --associate-public-ip-address --tag-specifications "ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=$PREP_SYSTEM_NAME}]" --block-device-mappings "DeviceName=/dev/sdh,Ebs={VolumeSize=50}"
----
+
____
If you see `An error occurred (InvalidAMIID.NotFound) when calling the RunInstances operation: The image id '[ami-06640050dc3f556bb]' does not exist`, it may be because you're running in a region other than `us-east-1`.
You'll need to either switch to `us-east-1` or else substitute the correct RHEL AMI for your region https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home[here].
____

== Downloading Tooling

Now that our prep system is up, let's SSH into it and download the content we'll need to support our install on the high side.

. Grab the IP address for the prep system and SSH into it using `disco_key`:
+
[,execute]
----
PREP_SYSTEM_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=$PREP_SYSTEM_NAME" | jq -r '.Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress')
echo $PREP_SYSTEM_IP

ssh -i ~/disco_key ec2-user@$PREP_SYSTEM_IP
----
+
____
If your `ssh` command times out here, your prep system is likely still booting up.
Give it a minute and try again.
____

. Let's mount the EBS volume we attached so we can build our collection of stuff to ship to the high side:
+
[,execute]
----
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1
sudo mkdir /mnt/high-side
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/high-side
sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user /mnt/high-side
----

. Let's grab the tools we'll need for the bastion server - we'll use some of them on the prep system too.
Life's good on the low side;
we can download these from the Internet and tuck them into our high side gift basket at `/mnt/high-side`:
 ** `oc`: OpenShift CLI
+
[,execute]
----
 cd /mnt/high-side

 curl https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz -L -o oc.tar.gz
 tar -xzf oc.tar.gz oc
 rm -f oc.tar.gz
 sudo cp oc /usr/local/bin/
----

 ** `oc-mirror`: oc plugin for mirorring release, operator, and helm content
+
[,execute]
----
curl https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/stable/oc-mirror.tar.gz -L -o oc-mirror.tar.gz
tar -xzf oc-mirror.tar.gz
rm -f oc-mirror.tar.gz
chmod +x oc-mirror
sudo cp oc-mirror /usr/local/bin/
----

 ** `mirror-registry`: small-scale Quay registry designed for mirroring
+
[,execute]
----
curl https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/mirror-registry/latest/mirror-registry.tar.gz -L -o mirror-registry.tar.gz
tar -xzf mirror-registry.tar.gz
rm -f mirror-registry.tar.gz
----

 ** `openshift-installer`: OpenShift Installer
+
[,execute]
----
curl https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz -L -o openshift-installer.tar.gz
tar -xzf openshift-installer.tar.gz openshift-install
rm -f openshift-installer.tar.gz
----

== Mirroring Content to Disk

The `oc-mirror` plugin supports mirroring content directly from upstream sources to a mirror registry, but since there is an air gap between our low side and high side, that's not an option for this lab.
Instead, we'll mirror content to a tarball on disk that we can then sneakernet into the bastion server on the high side.
We'll then mirror from the tarball into the mirror registry from there.

. We'll first need an OpenShift pull secret to authenticate to the Red Hat registries.
If you're in a guided workshop, your instructor may provide this for you.
Otherwise, grab your own from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Hybrid Cloud Console].
You'll need to `mkdir ~/.docker` and save it to `~/.docker/config.json` on your prep system.
. Next, we need to generate an `ImageSetConfiguration` that describes the parameters of our mirror.
You can generate one like this:
+
[,execute]
----
oc mirror init > imageset-config.yaml
----

. To save time and storage, we're going to remove the operator catalogs and mirror only the release images.
We'll still get a fully functional cluster, but *OperatorHub* will be empty.
You'll want to have a strategy for mirroring operator content in a real world scenario.
+
Notice that you can specify `additionalImages` here, too.
We'll leave in the `ubi` image that was generated so we can run some tests later.
*Remove the `operators` object from your `imageset-config.yaml`* so that it looks like this:
+
[,bash]
----
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
storageConfig:
  local:
    path: ./
mirror:
  platform:
    channels:
    - name: stable-4.15
      type: ocp
  additionalImages:
  - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest
  helm: {}
----

. Now we're ready to kick off the mirror!
This should take a few minutes, but we can get started on the next lab in a new terminal while it's running.
+
[,execute]
----
oc mirror --config imageset-config.yaml file:///mnt/high-side
----
