If you made it here, congratulations!
You have officially stood up a disconnected cluster!

You should be able to access the API server from the bastion by leveraging the `kubeconfig` file the installer creates for you:

[,execute]
----
export KUBECONFIG=/mnt/high-side/install/auth/kubeconfig
oc status
----

Example output:

[,bash]
----
[ec2-user@ip-10-0-51-206 install]$ oc status
In project default on server https://api.disco.sandbox2099.opentlc.com:6443

svc/openshift - kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
svc/kubernetes - 172.30.0.1:443 -> 6443

View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list resources with 'oc get all'.

== Accessing the Web Console

Hitting the web console is a little bit trickier.
Our cluster not only lacks direct _egress_ to the Internet, but because it lives in a private subnet, we don't have _ingress_ either.
Notice that if you try to navigate to the address shown by running `oc whoami --show-console` in your laptop's browser, the request will fail.

To mitigate this, we'll use a handy SSH/DNS utility called `sshuttle` to setup an SSH tunnel to the prep system.

____
You'll need administrative privileges on your laptop to achieve this.
____

. First, you'll need to install sshuttle following the instructions for your operating system https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle#obtaining-sshuttle[here].
. Then you'll need to *copy your disco_key to your laptop*, and set permissions appropriately (`chmod 600 disco_key`).
. Then setup an SSH tunnel to the prep system.
This must be run from a terminal directly on your laptop:
+
[,bash]
----
PREP_SYSTEM_IP=<your prep system's public IP>

sshuttle --ssh-cmd 'ssh -i disco_key' -r ec2-user@$PREP_SYSTEM_IP 10.0.0.0/16 --dns
----
+
____
If you're prompted for a password here, enter your local laptop password.
____

. Now you should be able to access the console in your browser:
+
[,execute]
----
oc whoami --show-console
----
+
image:console.png[console] + Success!

Now the cluster's up and we can successfully access it.
But what comes next?
