Welcome to the OpenShift 4 Disconnected Workshop!
Here you'll learn about operating an OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network, or one without access to the Internet (even through a proxy or firewall).
This changes the way the cluster operates because things like container images, operator updates, and patches must be brought into the environment via *mirroring*.

=== Who uses disconnected networks?

Before we begin, consider a few use cases for disconnected networks:

* *Law enforcement*: Disconnected networks are private and purpose built
* *Research organizations*: Disconnected networks provide data governance
* *Industrial control*: Disconnected networks provide a security layer for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
* *The Military*: Disconnected networks provide alternative, reliable communication methods

=== Understanding our lab environment

Today's workshop is based on the *AWS Blank Open Environment* from the https://demo.redhat.com[Red Hat Demo Platform].
If you haven't already, go ahead and https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-test/sandboxes-gpte.sandbox-open.test&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link[order this service] so you're ready for the lab exercises.

There are of course many different options for installing OpenShift in a restricted network;
this is just one fairly opinionated approach.
We'll do our best to point out where there's the potential for variability along the way.

Away we go!
